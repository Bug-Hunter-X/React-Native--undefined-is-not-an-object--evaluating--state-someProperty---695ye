This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  In React Native, when the component mounts, the state is initially undefined. If you attempt to use a state value before it's been set in the `useState` hook, or if there's a race condition where the component renders before the state update completes, you get `undefined` is not an object (evaluating 'state.someProperty') error.

```javascript
// Buggy Component
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count.toString()}</Text> {/* Error here if count is not defined yet */}
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
